#
# - This file is suitable for running the Flask web app (app_flask.py).
# - Desktop-only GUI packages are listed under [OPTIONAL / DESKTOP].
# - TensorFlow is commented out (heavy; install only when training CNN locally).
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - For consistent deploys on Render / Heroku, pin a Python version (e.g. runtime.txt -> python-3.10.8).
# - Keep TensorFlow out of the cloud deploy unless you know the target host supports it.

# -------------------------
# Core numeric & audio libs
# Only include versions known to be compatible with Python 3.10/3.11.
numpy>=1.23.5,<2.0
scipy>=1.9.3,<2.0
librosa>=0.9.2,<0.13
soundfile>=0.11.0

# numba/llvmlite are helpful on Windows for librosa performance; include if you need them locally
numba>=0.55.2; platform_system == "Windows"
llvmlite>=0.39.1; platform_system == "Windows"

# -------------------------
# Machine learning
scikit-learn>=1.1.3,<1.3
joblib>=1.2.0

# -------------------------
# Web / server
Flask>=2.0
gunicorn>=20.0

# -------------------------
# Plotting & visualization

# -------------------------
# Optional audio playback (only needed for local desktop playback)
simpleaudio>=1.0.4 ; platform_system != "Linux"

# -------------------------
# OPTIONAL / DESKTOP GUI (only for local desktop apps)
# If you are running the CTk desktop GUI locally (not on a web host), uncomment the line below.
# customtkinter is not required for the Flask web app and can cause deploy issues on PaaS.
# customtkinter>=5.2.2

# -------------------------
# OPTIONAL / CNN (only if you plan to train or run the CNN locally)
# TensorFlow is large and often incompatible with small/free cloud hosts.
# Install manually on the machines where you train/run the CNN.
# Example (CPU): pip install tensorflow==2.12.0
# Uncomment below only if you *need* TF on this environment:
# tensorflow==2.12.0
